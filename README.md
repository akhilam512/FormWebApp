# FormWebApp
A simple form submission web app made using Node, Express and MySQL.

When the server.js file is run on the localhost, the home page is displayed :
![home page](readme files/Home. - Mozilla Firefox_004.png)

- When the Sign In button is clicked, the registration form page is displayed :
![ sign up form](/read me files/Sign up - Mozilla Firefox_006.png)

When the user submits all the required data, a "Success" page is displayed:
![success sign up](/read me files/Success! - Mozilla Firefox_007.png)

- When the user opts to sign in from the Home page, the log in page is displayed:
![ sign in form](/read me files/Sign In - Mozilla Firefox_008.png)

And if the user enters the correct registered data, a "Successful login" page is shown:
![ success sign in](/read me files/Success! - Mozilla Firefox_009.png) 

All of the user data is stored in a MySQL database. 

Features coming soon: client side verification of data, encrypted password storage, better interface.
