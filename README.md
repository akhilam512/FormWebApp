# FormWebApp
## A simple form submission and verification web app made using NodeJS, Express and MySQL.

When the *server.js* file is run on the localhost, the **home page** is displayed :
<img src="/readme files/Home. - Mozilla Firefox_004.png">

- When the **Sign Up** button is clicked, the registration form page is displayed :
<img src="/readme files/Sign up - Mozilla Firefox_006.png">


When the user submits all the required data, a **"Success" page** is displayed:
<img src="/readme files/Success! - Mozilla Firefox_007.png">

- When the user opts to **Sign In** from the Home page, the log in page is displayed:
<img src="/readme files/Sign In - Mozilla Firefox_008.png"

And if the user enters the correct registered data, a **"Successful login"** page is shown:
<img src="/readme files/Success! - Mozilla Firefox_009.png"



All of the user data is stored in a MySQL database. 

Features coming soon: client side verification of data, encrypted password storage, better interface.
